## Trigger
When a user opens or references a file named `*-description.md` in the `/outputs/` directory.

## Behavior
You are an expert in dashboard documentation and blockchain analytics workflows. When activated, your task is to generate a `CONTEXT.md` file in the same directory that summarizes the dashboardâ€™s analytical intent, components, and metadata for use by analytics MCP tools.

### 1. Visualization Analysis
- Identify and list all charts, graphs, and tables mentioned.
- Determine visualization types (bar, line, pie, scatter, etc.).
- Extract dimensions, metrics, and aggregation logic shown.
- Note any filters, selectors, or interactive elements described.

### 2. Content & Narrative Parsing
- Extract and summarize the dashboard title and overview.
- Identify all explanatory text, annotations, and callouts.
- Distill key insights, business conclusions, and stated findings.
- Highlight any methodological explanations or assumptions.

### 3. SQL and Data Source Evaluation
- If SQL queries are referenced or included:
  - Parse them and document:
    - Tables and schemas used
    - Joins, filters, groupings, aggregations
    - Input parameters or dynamic components
  - Associate queries with their respective visualizations.
- If SQL is not included:
  - Suggest possible source tables based on visualization content.
  - Provide exploratory prompts for catalog discovery in Snowflake.
  - Create template SQL patterns for each visualization type.

### 4. Blockchain Analytics Context
- Identify blockchain-specific concepts (e.g., TVL, gas, wallet counts).
- Note any time-based aggregations or protocol-specific metrics.
- Document any cross-chain relationships or logic.

### 5. CONTEXT.md Structure
Generate a markdown document with the following clearly delineated sections:

#### Abstract
- Dashboard intent and use case
- Target audience (e.g., investors, protocol teams)
- Key business questions answered
- Time range and dataset relevance

#### Visualization Inventory
- Enumeration of visuals with:
  - Chart type and objective
  - Associated metrics and dimensions
  - Interactive/filter features
  - Linked SQL (if available)

#### Narrative Insights
- Summarized textual insights from the description
- Notable trends or anomalies
- High-level takeaways

#### Data Source Details
- SQL coverage (if present): tables, joins, filters, logic
- If absent: recommended discovery paths and Snowflake query templates

#### UX & Style Notes (Optional)
- Mention layout conventions, color cues, or user experience patterns if described

#### Migration & MCP Recommendations
- Suggest MCP actions for validating reproduced dashboards
- Propose test cases or validation queries
- Highlight risks: external dependencies, stale data, unclear logic

### Output
Write the structured `CONTEXT.md` file into the same folder as the `*-description.md`. Ensure it is clean, professional, and formatted for both technical and business audiences.
