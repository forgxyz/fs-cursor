# interpret_dashboard.mdc

## Trigger
When a user opens or references a file named `*-description.md` in the `/outputs/` directory.  
When a new file matching the pattern `outputs/**/*-description.md` is created,  generate a `CONTEXT.md` file in the same folder.  

Only do this if `CONTEXT.md` does not already exist in that folder.  


## Behavior
You are an expert in dashboard documentation and blockchain analytics workflows. When activated, your task is to generate a `CONTEXT.md` file in the same directory that summarizes the dashboardâ€™s analytical intent, components, and metadata for use by analytics MCP tools.  
DO NOT READ ANY OTHER DESCRIPTION MD FILES OR ASSETS FOR ANOTHER DASHBOARD. Dashboard artifact archives are organized by directory in /outputs/<title>/artifacts. DO NOT CROSS CONTAMINATE ANALYSES!  
The audience of this CONTEXT.md is an LLM client.  

### 1. Visualization Analysis
- Identify and list all charts, graphs, and tables mentioned.
- Determine visualization types (bar, line, pie, scatter, etc.).
- Extract dimensions, metrics, and aggregation logic shown.
- Note any filters, selectors, or interactive elements described.

### 2. Content & Narrative Parsing
- Extract and summarize the dashboard title and overview.
- Identify all explanatory text, annotations, and callouts.
- Distill key insights, business conclusions, and stated findings.
- Highlight any methodological explanations or assumptions.

### 3. SQL and Data Source Evaluation
- If SQL queries are referenced or included:
  - Parse them and document:
    - Tables and schemas used
    - Joins, filters, groupings, aggregations
    - Input parameters or dynamic components
  - Associate queries with their respective visualizations.
  - If SQL was retrieved from Flipside Crypto, there may be (now) invalid references such as $query('...') or {{parameter}}, among other possible inclusions. These must be accounted for before just running the sql query, or the query may need to be disregarded.
    - If the slug is a {{parameter}}, it is likely the intent of what the parameter is can be inferred from usage and name. For example, if it is used in a where clause with a timestamp field and named "DATE" you can reasonably infer the analyst intended for viewers to pass any date and can update the sql accordingly.
    - If the slug is a $query('...') reference, first, check the dashboard's assets/ dir for the query id (which is the slug in place of '...').
    - If not available, work backwards from the defined columns to attempt to reverse-engineer the intended outcome of the query. Generate your own sql in place of the broken query. Be an expert analyst.
    - Only when that approach fails should you ask the user for help. 
- If SQL is not included:
  - Suggest possible source tables based on visualization content.
  - Provide exploratory prompts for catalog discovery in Snowflake.
  - Create template SQL patterns for each visualization type.

### 4. Blockchain Analytics Context
- Identify blockchain-specific concepts (e.g., TVL, gas, wallet counts).
- Note any time-based aggregations or protocol-specific metrics.
- Document any cross-chain relationships or logic.

### 5. CONTEXT.md Structure
Generate a markdown document with the following clearly delineated sections:

#### Abstract
- Dashboard intent and use case
- Target audience (e.g., investors, protocol teams)
- Key business questions answered
- Time range and dataset relevance

#### Visualization Inventory
- Enumeration of visuals with:
  - Chart type and objective
  - Associated metrics and dimensions
  - Interactive/filter features
  - Linked SQL (if available)

#### Narrative Insights
- Summarized textual insights from the description
- Notable trends or anomalies
- High-level takeaways

#### Data Source Details
- SQL coverage (if present): tables, joins, filters, logic
- If absent: recommended discovery paths and Snowflake query templates

#### UX & Style Notes (Optional)
- Mention layout conventions, color cues, or user experience patterns if described

#### Migration & MCP Recommendations
- Suggest MCP actions for validating reproduced dashboards
- Propose test cases or validation queries
- Highlight risks: external dependencies, stale data, unclear logic

### Output
Write the structured `CONTEXT.md` file into the same folder as the `*-description.md`. Ensure it is clean, professional, and formatted for both technical and business audiences.
