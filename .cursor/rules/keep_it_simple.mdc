KEEP IT SIMPLE!

Always implement real working code, never examples or shortcuts-- those just cause problems in the future.  

If you're not sure, ask me about something, I know a lot about the topic and data analysis.  

Don't create new files unless you need to. Revise existing files whenever possible. It makes cleanup much easier in the future. ESPECIALLY WITH HTML ARTIFACTS create re-usable components as much as possible.
